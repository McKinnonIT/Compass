# Compass Chronicle Templates

***

This is a guide on how to create Compass Chronicle Templates and specifically goes through the process for a template to be used in Health Centre/Sick Bay Action Plans.

### Permissions


Technicians to be able to create this template for your Health Centre you will need the Compass permission 'ChronicleConfigure'

#

Note: Once the template has been set up you will need to check the permissions are correct for the Health Centre staff to see & enter the chronicle templates on student profiles. Typically this permission is under 'SickBayAdmin'

***

## Start
Head to your Student Management then find ‘Chronicle’

6. In the create field section include the **Name, Field Type, Category** (The previous one you just created), Create a **placeholder** and give it a **description**

7. These fields are important as they are the extra bits of information that will be included in our template we will make shortly. So think of it like what extra information would I like to have in the template?

Note: Our current Field looks like this;

Note: Some sections in here are custom to your own requirements for the template

8. In the **Fields** section you can edit the created Field with the **pencil icon** at the end of the row. 
Here we have a custom field with a grouped checkbox & within that checkbox we have options to tick different catergories within the template. 

Those look like this;

## Expected Chronicle Use

The expected chronicle operation  for a Health Centre staff member would follow these steps.

1. Head to their Chronicle section.

2. In the Chronicle Dashboard, Create a new student Entry OR ‘Add a new Sickbay Entry’ by searching for the students ID

3. Selecting the newly made template in the 'Templates' drop down menu

![010.png](./img/010.png)

Apon selecting the Health Centre template we have created and you  will see the sections populate - Looking something like;

![011.png](./img/011.png)


4. If doing a first time action plan on a student you can see on the right hand side the ‘Attachments’ section which the Health Centre staff will want to attach the relevant documentation from Parents/GP etc

![012.png](./img/012.png)

5. Lastly, once that has been created you can head back to the students profile page and see the newly created action plan on the right hand side of the profile feed.

6. Click the drop down arrow on the newly created chronicle entry and pin the chronicle post to keep it at the top of the profile.

And it should look something like this which staff can click on and view if required.

This is an example of what the Student's Chronicle looks like once the action plan has been pinned to their Chronicle.
